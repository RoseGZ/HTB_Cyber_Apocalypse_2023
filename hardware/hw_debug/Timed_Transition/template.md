## Introduction

As part of your initialization sequence, your team loaded various tools into your system, but you still need to learn how to use them effectively. They have tasked you with the challenge of finding the appropriate tool to open a file containing strange serial signals. Can you rise to the challenge and find the right tool?

## Tools Used

- [Tool 1]
- [Tool 2]
- [Tool 3]

## Initial Analysis

[Explain your initial thoughts and observations upon receiving the challenge. Describe any clues, hints, or files provided.]

## Detailed Methodology

### Step 1: Auto-Recon

Run automated tools for the type of system you are investigating.

[Provide a clear explanation of the step, including commands, code snippets (if applicable), and reasoning behind the step. Include screenshots or images where appropriate to illustrate your process.]

### Step 2: Manually Interact with the Target

Manually browse the target and interact with it. Understand how it works, what is the purpose of the application and how normal users interact with it.

[Provide a clear explanation of the step, including commands, code snippets (if applicable), and reasoning behind the step. Include screenshots or images where appropriate to illustrate your process.]

### Step 3: Identify technology stack

Identify the technology stack of the application. This will help you understand how the application works and what are the possible vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Identify Potential Vulnerabilities
[Provide a clear explanation of the step, including commands, code snippets (if applicable), and reasoning behind the step. Include screenshots or images where appropriate to illustrate your process.]
- idor, because blabla 
- weak auth, because blabla
- xss, because blabla

### Step 5: Exploitation
[Provide a clear explanation of the step, including commands, code snippets (if applicable), and reasoning behind the step. Include screenshots or images where appropriate to illustrate your process.]

#### Step 5a Exploitation of IDOR

#### Step 5b Exploitation of weak auth

#### Step 5c Exploitation of xss

## Flag Capture

[Detail the steps leading to the capture of the flag. Include the flag itself (in a spoiler or hidden text, if necessary). Anyone reading this writeup should be able to follow your steps and capture the flag themselves.]
