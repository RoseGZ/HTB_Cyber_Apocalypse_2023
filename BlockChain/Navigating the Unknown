## Introduction

Your advanced sensory systems make it easy for you to navigate familiar environments, but you must rely on intuition to navigate in unknown territories. Through practice and training, you must learn to read subtle cues and become comfortable in unpredictable situations. Can you use your software to find your way through the blocks?

## Tools Used

- netcat
- [Tool 2]
- [Tool 3]

## Initial Analysis

I was given two different IP addresses and port numbers. The first was a TCP (open) port. The second was a TCP (filtered) port. 

## Detailed Methodology

### Step 1: Auto-Recon


### Step 2: Manually Interact with the Target

I decided to check the two IP addresses. First used a netcat command to the TCP port 165.232.98.59:31678 
Got 3 responses: 
1) Connection information
2) Restart Instance
3) Get flag

TCP Port Return
1-> Private key     :  0xdc4f90ae96d3a8af7374a88dbb36ca69bb0cc6d858ef0500ddc155bbab920219
    Address         :  0x57919733Aba4a311e541d8B8DC55eA34371f58B8
    Target contract :  0x0098C793D56d76404f75031Fd498489B10A6D0B7
    Setup contract  :  0x36A61cA28026F097cA230b6D2330910AD0bE9707
2-> Restart done. Please retrieve the new connection information.
3-> 
1-> After restart :
    Private key     :  0x7152369b55dd146458692da7d65a62687ef3a380b72d882ae4ddde308651a0b8
    Address         :  0x07C143D22daB00A901B69f4A7b4B8E66BF47c344
    Target contract :  0x7beFea016F816842C33b256CB73A82FC201b8Fee
    Setup contract  :  0xa73649D35B40A2f9D755129F80CeF59562C09311

When inserting action number that was not planned (1,2,3), the response was "can you not". 
When inserting action large action number, there was no response

Connection information changes after restart action.
netcat command did not work against port 32394. 


[Provide a clear explanation of the step, including commands, code snippets (if applicable), and reasoning behind the step. Include screenshots or images where appropriate to illustrate your process.]

### Step 3: Identify technology stack

Identify the technology stack of the application. This will help you understand how the application works and what are the possible vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Identify Potential Vulnerabilities
[Provide a clear explanation of the step, including commands, code snippets (if applicable), and reasoning behind the step. Include screenshots or images where appropriate to illustrate your process.]
- idor, because blabla 
- weak auth, because blabla
- xss, because blabla

### Step 5: Exploitation
[Provide a clear explanation of the step, including commands, code snippets (if applicable), and reasoning behind the step. Include screenshots or images where appropriate to illustrate your process.]

#### Step 5a Exploitation of IDOR

#### Step 5b Exploitation of weak auth

#### Step 5c Exploitation of xss

## Flag Capture

[Detail the steps leading to the capture of the flag. Include the flag itself (in a spoiler or hidden text, if necessary). Anyone reading this writeup should be able to follow your steps and capture the flag themselves.]
